Voice-Activated Information Assistant project:

Voice-Activated Information Assistant
This project is a voice-activated personal assistant that leverages text-to-speech (pyttsx3) and speech recognition (SpeechRecognition) libraries, combined with Selenium for web automation. The assistant listens to voice commands, responds with appropriate information, and can fetch details from Wikipedia.

Features
Voice Interaction: Interact with the assistant using voice commands.
Text-to-Speech: The assistant responds to your queries with spoken answers.
Web Automation: Automatically searches and retrieves information from Wikipedia.
User-Friendly Prompts: Guides the user through the interaction process.

Code Explanation
Main Components
Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3): Initializes the speech engine and sets the voice properties.
Speech Recognition (sr): Listens for the user's voice input and converts it to text.
Selenium: Automates the web browser to search for information on Wikipedia.
Assistant Workflow
Initialization:

Initializes the speech engine and sets voice properties.
Greets the user and asks for a command.
Listening and Responding:

Listens for the user's command using the microphone.
Processes the command and provides appropriate responses.
Information Retrieval:

If the command is related to fetching information, the assistant prompts for the topic.
Uses Selenium to open Wikipedia, search for the topic, and keep the browser open until manually closed.
Error Handling
Handles unknown speech inputs by prompting the user to repeat.
Ensures the browser is closed properly in case of errors.
Future Improvements
Enhance the assistant's understanding and response capabilities using NLP.
Add support for more websites and information sources.
Implement a GUI for better user interaction.
